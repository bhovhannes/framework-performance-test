# framework-performance-test
Contains tests for measuring performance of different front-end frameworks.

Visit http://bhovhannes.github.io/framework-performance-test/demo/ to play with tests yourself.

You may change data size by tweaking values in `src/common/dataSize.js`.

If playing with demo locally, make sure to run `npm run deploy` before visiting demo to test against production-ready versions of libraries. Performance can vary significantly when using development version.
